## Student Information
 Student Name: Ayesha Bibi
 Roll Number: 100042
 Semester: 5th
 Course Name: Digital Image Processing (DIP)
 Institute: Govt Graduate College, Multan Road Burewala

## Project Description
This project converts digital images into pencil sketch images using image processing techniques.
The system processes a dataset of images automatically.
Grayscale conversion, blurring, and edge detection are applied.
The project is implemented using Python and OpenCV.

## Objectives
- To convert color images into pencil sketch format
- To understand basic Digital Image Processing techniques
- To apply edge detection algorithms
- To process multiple images from a dataset

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Steps to Run the Code
1. Upload dataset.zip to Google Colab
2. Place dataset.zip in the working directory
3. Run all cells in main.ipynb
4. Images will be extracted automatically
5. Pencil sketch images will be generated and displayed

## Sample Input and Output Images
- Input: Original color images from dataset
- Output: Pencil sketch images generated using edge detection

## Conclusion
The project successfully converts digital images into pencil sketch images using Digital Image Processing techniques. It helped in understanding image preprocessing and edge detection algorithms.
